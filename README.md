# Chronicler

**A lightweight, dependency-free logging library for Python.**

Chronicler is a minimalistic yet powerful logging solution for Python projects. It provides all the essential features you need, with a focus on simplicity, readability, and ease of integration. It supports multiple log levels, caller tracing, log file rotation, and automatic cleanup to keep your logs organized without manual maintenance.

---

## ‚òùÔ∏èü§ì Features

- **Five Standard Logging Levels**  
  DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL.

- **Effortless Setup**  
  Initialize and use Chronicler with a single line of code.

- **Caller Tracing**  
  Automatically includes the filename and line number of each log message, aiding quick debugging.

- **Colorized Console Output**  
  Makes logs easy to read by giving each level its own color in the terminal.

- **File Logging Support**  
  Seamlessly log output to files alongside console output.

- **Automatic Log Rotation**  
  Start a new log file daily or on each execution to keep logs concise.

- **Automatic Cleanup**  
  Keeps your environment tidy by deleting old log files once exceeding a defined limit.

- **Zero Dependencies**  
  Runs out of the box on any standard Python installation.

## üì¶ Installation

Chronicler does not require installation from PyPI. Simply include it in your project structure:

```
your_project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chronicler/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ chronicler.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ your_main_script.py
```

---

## üß™ Running the Tests

Tests use **pytest** and **freezegun** (for testing log rotation by date).

1. Install the test dependencies:

```
pip install pytest freezegun
```

2. Place your tests in a `tests/` directory. For example:

```
your_project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_chronicler.py
```

3. Run the tests:

```
pytest
```

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
from chronicler import Chronicler

# Create a logger (default level is INFO).
log = Chronicler()

log.info("This is an info message.")
log.warning("This is a warning.")
log.error("Uh oh, an error occurred.", error_code=500)

# This debug message won't show by default.
log.debug("This is a debug message.")
```

### Using the Default Logger

```python
from chronicler import log

log.info("This uses the default logger!")
```

---

### Changing the Log Level

```python
debug_logger = Chronicler(level='DEBUG')
debug_logger.debug("Now you see me!")
```

---

### Saving Logs to a File

```python
file_logger = Chronicler(log_file='my_app.log')
file_logger.info("This will appear in both console and my_app.log.")
```

---

### Setting Up Log Rotation

#### Daily Rotation

```python
daily_logger = Chronicler(
    log_file='app.log',
    rotation_policy='daily',
    max_files=7  # Keeps logs for the last 7 days
)

daily_logger.info("This goes into 'app_YYYY-MM-DD.log'.")
```

#### Per Execution Rotation

```python
exec_logger = Chronicler(
    log_file='script.log',
    rotation_policy='execution',
    max_files=5  # Keeps logs from the last 5 runs
)

exec_logger.info("A new log file is created every run.")
```
